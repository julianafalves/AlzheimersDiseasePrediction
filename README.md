##Alzheimer's Disease Prediction 

* **notes**: I add any notes to this folder, this can be anything! URLs to useful webpages, chapters/pages of books, descriptions of variables, a rough outline of the task at hand, etc.

* **input**: This folder contains all of the input files and data for the machine learning project. For example, it may contain CSV files, text embedding, or images (in another subfolder though), to list a few things.


* **src**: Any .py file is kept in this folder. Simple.
models: We keep all of our trained models in here (the useful onesâ€¦).


* **notebooks**: We can store our Jupyter notebooks here (any .ipynb file). Note that I tend to only use notebooks for data exploration and plotting.
